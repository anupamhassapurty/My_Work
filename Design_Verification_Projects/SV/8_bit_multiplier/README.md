# 8 Bit Multiplier Verification Plan

## Objective
The objective of this project is to verify the functionality of an 8-bit multiplier designed in System Verilog. The verification will ensure that the multiplier performs accurate binary multiplication of two 8-bit inputs, producing a correct 16-bit product as output.

## Inputs
- Two 8-bit binary numbers.

## Expected Output
- A 16-bit binary product resulting from the multiplication of the input values.

## Verification Methodology
- This verification project utilizes the System Verilog language and follows the Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) for verification.
- Verification tests and sequences are designed to verify the correctness of the multiplier's operation under various scenarios and corner cases.
- Assertions and coverage metrics will be employed to ensure comprehensive verification.
